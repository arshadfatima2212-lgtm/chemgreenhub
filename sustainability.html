        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                water purification, process by which undesired chemical compounds, organic and inorganic materials, and biological contaminants are removed from water. That process also includes distillation (the conversion of a liquid into vapour to condense it back to liquid form) and deionization (ion removal through the extraction of dissolved salts). One major purpose of water purification is to provide clean drinking water. Water purification also meets the needs of medical, pharmacological, chemical, and industrial applications for clean and potable water. The purification procedure reduces the concentration of contaminants such as suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, and fungi. Water purification takes place on scales from the large (e.g., for an entire city) to the small (e.g., for individual households).
        
              <h4>Determining water quality</h4>  
             Historical evidence suggests that water treatment was recognized and practiced by ancient civilizations. Basic treatments for water purification have been documented in Greek and Sanskrit writings, and Egyptians used alum for precipitation as early as 1500 bce.
             In modern times, the quality to which water must be purified is typically set by government agencies. Whether set locally, nationally, or internationally, government standards typically set maximum concentrations of harmful contaminants that can be allowed in safe water. Since it is nearly impossible to examine water simply on the basis of appearance, multiple processes, such as physical, chemical, or biological analyses, have been developed to test contamination levels. Levels of organic and inorganic chemicals, such as chloride, copper, manganese, sulfates, and zinc, microbial pathogens, radioactive materials, and dissolved and suspended solids, as well as pH, odour, colour, and taste, are some of the common parameters analyzed to assess water quality and contamination levels.

             <h4>Process</h4>
             Most water used in industrialized countries is treated at water treatment plants. Although the methods those plants use in pretreatment depend on their size and the severity of the contamination, those practices have been standardized to ensure general compliance with national and international regulations. The majority of water is purified after it has been pumped from its natural source or directed via pipelines into holding tanks. After the water has been transported to a central location, the process of purification begins.

             <h4>Pretreatment</h4>
             In pretreatment, biological contaminants, chemicals, and other materials are removed from water. The first step in that process is screening, which removes large debris such as sticks and trash from the water to be treated. Screening is generally used when purifying surface water such as that from lakes and rivers. Surface water presents a greater risk of having been polluted with large amounts of contaminants. Pretreatment may include the addition of chemicals to control the growth of bacteria in pipes and tanks (prechlorination) and a stage that incorporates sand filtration, which helps suspended solids settle to the bottom of a storage tank.

        <button class="accordion-btn">Air Pollution Control</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental problems worldwide. It occurs when harmful substances, including gases, particles, and biological molecules, are released into the atmosphere. Common pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants are primarily produced by vehicle emissions, industrial processes, burning fossil fuels, agricultural activities, and even natural events like wildfires and dust storms.
             <h4>Sources and Causes</h4>
             Industries such as cement, steel, and chemical plants emit large quantities of harmful gases and dust into the air. Transportation, especially diesel vehicles, contributes significantly to nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Agricultural practices like burning crop residues and excessive fertilizer use also release pollutants. Even domestic activities, like burning wood or coal for cooking and heating, can worsen air quality.

             <h4>Effects on Health and Environment</h4> 
             Air pollution has severe health impacts, including asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and weakened immune systems. It affects vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, more severely. Environmental effects include acid rain, which damages crops, forests, and water bodies, and smog formation in urban areas. Additionally, pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane contribute to global warming and climate change.

             <h4>Control Measure</h4>
             To control air pollution, governments and industries adopt a combination of strategies. Industries install filtration systems like electrostatic precipitators and scrubbers to capture harmful particles before release. Cleaner fuels, such as natural gas or electricity, replace coal and diesel. Transportation policies promoting electric vehicles, public transit, and carpooling also reduce emissions. Public awareness campaigns encourage individuals to reduce energy consumption, plant trees, and adopt environmentally friendly habits.

        <button class="accordion-btn">Waste Recycling</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                Recycling waste helps reduce landfill use and recovers valuable materials. Chemical engineers develop processes to recycle industrial and urban waste
                into reusable materials such as plastics, metals, and biofuels.
                With rapid urbanization and industrialization, the amount of solid waste generated worldwide is increasing dramatically. Improper disposal leads to soil and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of natural resources. Recycling is an effective way to manage waste sustainably and conserve resources.

             <h4>Importance of Recycling</h4>
             Recycling reduces the demand for raw materials such as timber, metals, and plastics. It lowers energy consumption because manufacturing from recycled materials typically uses less energy than production from virgin resources. Recycling also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and minimizes the negative environmental impacts of waste in landfills.

             <h4>Methods of Recycling</h4> 
	        •	Mechanical Recycling: Materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals are sorted, cleaned, and processed into new products.
	        •	Composting: Organic waste, including kitchen scraps and garden waste, is converted into nutrient-rich compost, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.
	        •	Chemical Recycling: Some plastics and industrial waste can be broken down chemically into raw materials for reuse.
	        •	E-Waste Recycling: Electronic waste, such as old phones and computers, contains valuable metals like gold and copper. Proper recycling prevents toxic substances like lead and mercury from contaminating soil and water.

            <h4>Benefits of Recycling</h4>
             Recycling conserves natural resources, reduces energy consumption, decreases pollution, and extends the life of landfills. It also creates employment opportunities in collection, processing, and manufacturing, promoting a circular economy where materials are reused instead of discarded.
